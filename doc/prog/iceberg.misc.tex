There is a pretty efficient algorithm proposed by Karp Papadimtrioue Shanke, that is finding candidates in a single traversal on the data (it was basically designed for stream processing) in order to find items that have frequency of at least theta for any theta in (0,1).

The algorithm in high level:

    Collect elements into PF, counting their appearances
    Whenever 1/Î¸ distinct elements are encountered, decrease all counters by 1 and remove from PF those whose counters are zero
    Output the elements in PF that survive this process

The algorithm yields 1/Theta (at most) candidates, and it has no false negatives (doesn't miss any candidate) - but it does have some false positives (some candidates are not frequent).

For simplicity, assuming 1/Theta is an integer.

Pseudo Code:

PF = {} //empty dictionary
for each element e:
   if PF.contains(e):
       PF[e] = PF[e] + 1
   else:
       PF[e] = 1
       if PF.size() == 1/Theta:
             for each element k in PF:
                PF[k] = PF[k] - 1
                if PF[k] == 0:
                     remove k from PF
When done, all elements in PF are your candidates.
