If you need to get the configuration of a running Linux kernel, have a look at:

/proc/config.gz

You might use that like this:

zcat /proc/config.gz > /usr/src/linux/.config

If /proc/config.gz isn't there (ie the kernel was compiled without CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC) have a look at:

/usr/src/linux/scripts/extract-ikconfig
